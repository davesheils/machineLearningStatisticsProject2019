### Contents and Assignment Objectives

- **Introduction**
This section will introduce the data

- **Describe**
This section describes the data set. Particular emphasis is given to the variation in MEDV, the variable representing the median house price. In addition, the relationship between MEDV and other variables will be explored by drawing a correlation matrix and plotting relevant relationships.

- **Infer**
This is treated as a case study in analysing the relationship between house price and other variables, namely location. More specifically, inferential statistics are employed to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that are not. To this effect, a T-Test is employed to see if there is a significantly significant difference between these two subsets.

- **Predict**
Use [keras](https://keras.io/) to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. The neural network will be tested with both the full set of inputs and a subset of input variables. The effect of pre-processing (scaling and whitening) will be analysed.
